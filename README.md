# Visualization-of-Cairos-Wheel
Visualization of Alberto Cairo's Wheel, inspired from Cairo's book: the functional art and Radar Chart map (site:http://bl.ocks.org/nbremer/21746a9668ffdf6d8242)
My major purpose for this project was to generate Visualization Cairo's Wheel with d3.js. At first glance, looking at the Cairo's wheel--it reminded me of radar chart. This inspired me to borrow this code from The radar chart and manipulating the code to work for Visualization of Cairos  Wheel.
To explain Visualization of Cairos Wheel works you can refer to Chapter 3 The Beauty Paradox: Art and Communication from book, the funtional art by Cairo. 
12 axes correponds to the main features how you (as the artist/designer) need to balance when you design information graphic. 
Along with this, I would also like to give many Thanks to Nadieh Bremer (VisualCinnamon.com), the code of Alvaro Graves (alangrafu) and Alberto Cairo for his inspiration from the functional art. 
Thank you!
